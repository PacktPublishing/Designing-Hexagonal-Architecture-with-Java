$ docker build . -t topology-inventory-native -f Dockerfile-native
```
**To start the container with Uber Jar**
```
docker run -p 5555:8080 topology-inventory
```
**To start the container with native executable**
```
docker run -p 5555:8080 topology-inventory-native
```
**To access the Dockerized application**
```
